# Introduction

strlog is a structured logger, in which log records include a message, severity level, and bound set of fields representing key-value pairs.

strlog provides a logger which enables reporting events (records) of interest. Typically, a logger has a record handler assigned to it. A handler is responsible for handling emitted records. It can delegate them to an external interface (like a file or stdout), or simply ignore them.
